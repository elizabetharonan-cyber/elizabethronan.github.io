	abstract = {The trigeminal sensory neurons that innervate the tooth's vital interior-intradental neurons-are expected to drive severe pain, yet their  contribution to healthy tooth sensation has not been explored. Here, we uncover a  role for myelinated high-threshold mechano-nociceptors (intradental HTMRs) in  tooth protection using in vivo Ca(2+) imaging, opto-/chemogenetics, and the  AI-driven behavioral analysis tool LabGym. Intradental HTMRs innervate the inner  dentin through overlapping receptive fields and respond as the external  structures of the tooth are damaged in the absence of either PIEZO2 or Na(v)1.8.  Whereas chemogenetic activation of intradental HTMRs results in a pain phenotype  marked by facial and postural changes, their transient optogenetic activation  triggers a rapid, jaw-opening reflex via contraction of the digastric muscle. Our  work indicates that intradental HTMRs not only trigger pain but also protect the  teeth by initiating a reflexive movement of the jaws when the teeth experience  damage during chewing.},

	abstract = {Cinnamon, renowned for its aromatic flavor, represents one of the most widely used spices worldwide. Cinnamon is also considered beneficial to human health  with therapeutic potential for treating various diseases, ranging from diabetes  and cancer to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying  cinnamon's health benefits remain elusive. It is also unclear whether cinnamon  has any role in aging. Using C. elegans as a model, here we show that feeding  worms cinnamaldehyde (CA), the active ingredient in cinnamon oil, prolongs  longevity. CA also promotes stress resistance and reduces β-Amyloid toxicity in a  C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, CA exerts its  beneficial effects through mTORC1 and autophagy signaling. Interestingly, CA  promotes longevity by inducing a dietary restriction-like state without affecting  food intake, suggesting CA as a dietary restriction mimetic. In human cells, CA  exerts a similar effect on mTORC1 and autophagy signaling, suggesting a conserved  mechanism. Our results demonstrate that dietary cinnamon promotes both lifespan  and healthspan and does so by regulating mTORC1 and autophagy signaling.},

Within  a motor circuit, individual neurons tend to play discrete roles by promoting or  suppressing motor output. How exactly neurons function in specific roles to fine  tune motor output is not well understood. In C. elegans, the interneuron RIM  plays important yet complex roles in locomotion behavior. Here, we show that RIM  both promotes and suppresses distinct features of locomotion behavior to fine  tune motor output. This dual function is achieved via the excitation and  inhibition of the same motor circuit by electrical and chemical  neurotransmission, respectively. Additionally, this bi-directional regulation  contributes to motor adaptation in animals placed in novel environments. Our  findings reveal that individual neurons within a neural circuit may act in  opposing ways to regulate circuit dynamics to fine tune behavioral output.},

	abstract = {Despite lacking ears, the nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound and engages in phonotaxis behavior, enabling it to locate and avoid sound sources.(1) How  worms sense sound, however, is not well understood. Here, we report an  interesting observation that worms respond only to sounds emitted by small but  not large speakers, indicating that they preferentially respond to localized  sound sources. Notably, sounds emitted by small speakers form a sharp sound  pressure gradient across the worm body, while sounds from large speakers do not,  suggesting that worms sense sound pressure gradients rather than absolute sound  pressure. Analysis of phonotaxis behavior, sound-evoked skin vibration, and  sound-sensitive neuron activities further support this model. We suggest that the  ability to sense sound pressure gradients provides a potential mechanism for  worms to distinguish sounds generated by their predators, which are typically  small animals, from those produced by large animals or background noise. As  vertebrate cochlea and some insect ears can also detect sound pressure gradients,  our results reveal that sensing of sound pressure gradients may represent a  common mechanism in auditory sensation across animal phyla.

	abstract = {Unlike olfaction, taste, touch, vision, and proprioception, which are widespread across animal phyla, hearing is found only in vertebrates and some arthropods.  The vast majority of invertebrate species are thus considered insensitive to  sound. Here, we challenge this conventional view by showing that the earless  nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound at frequencies reaching the kHz range.  Sound vibrates C. elegans skin, which acts as a pressure-to-displacement  transducer similar to vertebrate eardrum, activates sound-sensitive FLP/PVD  neurons attached to the skin, and evokes phonotaxis behavior. We identified two  nAChRs that transduce sound signals independently of ACh, revealing an unexpected  function of nAChRs in mechanosensation. Thus, the ability to sense airborne sound  is not restricted to vertebrates and arthropods as previously thought, and might  have evolved multiple times independently in the animal kingdom, suggesting  convergent evolution. Our studies also demonstrate that animals without ears may  not be presumed to be sound insensitive.},

	abstract = {The eyeless C. elegans exhibits robust phototaxis behavior in response to short-wavelength light, particularly UV light. C. elegans senses light through  LITE-1, a unique photoreceptor protein that belongs to the invertebrate taste  receptor family. However, it remains unclear how LITE-1 is regulated. Here, we  performed a forward genetic screen for genes that when mutated suppress LITE-1  function. One group of lite-1 suppressors are the genes required for producing  the two primary antioxidants thioredoxin and glutathione, suggesting that  oxidization of LITE-1 inhibits its function. Indeed, the oxidant hydrogen  peroxide (H2O2) suppresses phototaxis behavior and inhibits the photoresponse in  photoreceptor neurons, whereas other sensory behaviors are relatively less  vulnerable to H2O2. Conversely, antioxidants can rescue the phenotype of lite-1  suppressor mutants and promote the photoresponse. As UV light illumination  generates H2O2, we propose that upon light activation of LITE-1, light-produced  H2O2 then deactivates LITE-1 to terminate the photoresponse, while antioxidants  may promote LITE-1's recovery from its inactive state. Our studies provide a  potential mechanism by which H2O2 and antioxidants act synergistically to  regulate photosensation in C. elegans.},

GLR-3 transmits cold signals via G protein  signaling independently of its glutamate-gated channel function, suggesting GLR-3  as a metabotropic cold receptor. The vertebrate GLR-3 homolog GluK2 from  zebrafish, mouse, and human can all function as a cold receptor in heterologous  systems. Mouse DRG sensory neurons express GluK2, and GluK2 knockdown in these  neurons suppresses their sensitivity to cold but not cool temperatures. Our study  identifies an evolutionarily conserved cold receptor, revealing that a central  chemical receptor unexpectedly functions as a thermal receptor in the periphery.},

Although nicotine treatment  stimulated locomotion speed in wild-type C. elegans, the same treatment reduced  locomotion speed in mutants defective in insulin signaling. This phenotype could  be suppressed by mutations in daf-16, a gene encoding a FOXO transcription factor  that acts downstream of insulin signaling. Our data suggest that insulin  signaling genes, daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, and akt-2, modulate behavioral  responses to nicotine in C. elegans, indicating a genetic link between nicotine  behavior and insulin signaling.},

Although this "temperature law" is widely accepted, it  has not been extensively tested. Here, we systematically evaluated the role of  temperature in lifespan regulation in C. elegans. We found that, although  exposure to low temperatures at the adult stage prolongs lifespan,  low-temperature treatment at the larval stage surprisingly reduces lifespan.  Interestingly, this differential effect of temperature on longevity in larvae and  adults is mediated by the same thermosensitive TRP channel TRPA-1 that signals to  the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. DAF-16/FOXO and TRPA-1 act in larva to  shorten lifespan but extend lifespan in adulthood. DAF-16/FOXO differentially  regulates gene expression in larva and adult in a temperature-dependent manner.  Our results uncover complexity underlying temperature modulation of longevity,  demonstrating that temperature differentially regulates lifespan at different  stages of life.},

	abstract = {Surgical intervention is often required to restore knee instability in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The most commonly used grafts for  ACL reconstruction are tendon autografts or allografts. These current options,  however, have shown failure rates requiring revision and continued instability in  the long term. The mismatched biomechanical properties of the current tendon  grafts compared with native ACL tissue are thought to contribute to these poor  outcomes and potential risk of early onset osteoarthritis. As a possible solution  to these issues, our laboratory has fabricated tissue-engineered ligament  constructs that exhibit structural and functional properties similar to those of  native ACL tissue after 6 months implantation. In addition, these  tissue-engineered grafts achieve vascular and neural development that exceeds  those of patellar tendon grafts. However, the utility of our tissue-engineered  grafts is limited by the labor-intensive method required to produce the  constructs and the need to use the constructs fresh, directly from the cell  culturing system. Ideally, these constructs would be fabricated and stored until  needed. Thus, in this study, we investigated the efficacy of freezing our  tissue-engineered constructs as a method of preservation before use for ACL  reconstruction. We hypothesized that frozen constructs would have similar  histological and biomechanical outcomes compared with our fresh model. Our  results showed that 6 months postimplantation as an ACL replacement graft, both  our tissue-engineered fresh and frozen grafts demonstrated similar mechanical and  histological outcomes, indicating that freezing is a suitable method for  preserving and storing our graft before ACL reconstruction. The ability to use  frozen constructs significantly increases the versatility of our graft technology  expanding the clinical utility of our graft.},
