AB  - In search of the molecular identities of cold-sensing receptors, we carried out 
      an unbiased genetic screen for cold-sensing mutants in C. elegans and isolated a 
      mutant allele of glr-3 gene that encodes a kainate-type glutamate receptor. While 
      glutamate receptors are best known to transmit chemical synaptic signals in the 
      CNS, we show that GLR-3 senses cold in the peripheral sensory neuron ASER to 
      trigger cold-avoidance behavior. GLR-3 transmits cold signals via G protein 
      signaling independently of its glutamate-gated channel function, suggesting GLR-3 
      as a metabotropic cold receptor. The vertebrate GLR-3 homolog GluK2 from 
      zebrafish, mouse, and human can all function as a cold receptor in heterologous 
      systems. Mouse DRG sensory neurons express GluK2, and GluK2 knockdown in these 
      neurons suppresses their sensitivity to cold but not cool temperatures. Our study 
      identifies an evolutionarily conserved cold receptor, revealing that a central 
      chemical receptor unexpectedly functions as a thermal receptor in the periphery.

AB  - Research using the model organism nematode C. elegans has greatly facilitated our 
      understanding of sensory biology, including touch, olfaction, taste, vision and 
      proprioception. While hearing had long been considered to be restricted to 
      vertebrates and some arthropods, we recently discovered that C. elegans is 
      capable of sensing and responding to airborne sound in a frequency and sound 
      source-size-dependent manner. C. elegans auditory sensation occurs when airborne 
      sound physically vibrates their external cuticle (skin) to activate the 
      sound-sensitive mechanosensory FLP/PVD neurons via nicotinic acetylcholine 
      receptors (nAChRs), triggering aversive phonotaxis behavior. Here, we report 
      stepwise methods to characterize these three features of C. elegans auditory 
      sensation, including sound-evoked skin vibration, neuronal activation, and 
      behavior. This approach provides an accessible platform to investigate the 
      cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying auditory sensation and 
      mechanotransduction mechanisms in C. elegans.

AB  - The trigeminal sensory neurons that innervate the tooth's vital 
      interior-intradental neurons-are expected to drive severe pain, yet their 
      contribution to healthy tooth sensation has not been explored. Here, we uncover a 
      role for myelinated high-threshold mechano-nociceptors (intradental HTMRs) in 
      tooth protection using in vivo Ca(2+) imaging, opto-/chemogenetics, and the 
      AI-driven behavioral analysis tool LabGym. Intradental HTMRs innervate the inner 
      dentin through overlapping receptive fields and respond as the external 
      structures of the tooth are damaged in the absence of either PIEZO2 or Na(v)1.8. 
      Whereas chemogenetic activation of intradental HTMRs results in a pain phenotype 
      marked by facial and postural changes, their transient optogenetic activation 
      triggers a rapid, jaw-opening reflex via contraction of the digastric muscle. Our 
      work indicates that intradental HTMRs not only trigger pain but also protect the 
      teeth by initiating a reflexive movement of the jaws when the teeth experience 
      damage during chewing.

AB  - Cinnamon, renowned for its aromatic flavor, represents one of the most widely 
      used spices worldwide. Cinnamon is also considered beneficial to human health 
      with therapeutic potential for treating various diseases, ranging from diabetes 
      and cancer to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying 
      cinnamon's health benefits remain elusive. It is also unclear whether cinnamon 
      has any role in aging. Using C. elegans as a model, here we show that feeding 
      worms cinnamaldehyde (CA), the active ingredient in cinnamon oil, prolongs 
      longevity. CA also promotes stress resistance and reduces β-Amyloid toxicity in a 
      C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanistically, CA exerts its 
      beneficial effects through mTORC1 and autophagy signaling. Interestingly, CA 
      promotes longevity by inducing a dietary restriction-like state without affecting 
      food intake, suggesting CA as a dietary restriction mimetic. In human cells, CA 
      exerts a similar effect on mTORC1 and autophagy signaling, suggesting a conserved 
      mechanism. Our results demonstrate that dietary cinnamon promotes both lifespan 
      and healthspan and does so by regulating mTORC1 and autophagy signaling.

AB  - Somatosensory innervation of the oral cavity enables the detection of a range of 
      environmental stimuli including minute and noxious mechanical forces. The 
      trigeminal sensory neurons underlie sensation originating from the tooth. Prior 
      work has provided important physiological and molecular characterization of 
      dental pulp sensory innervation. Clinical dental experiences have informed our 
      conception of the consequence of activating these neurons. However, the 
      biological role of sensory innervation within the tooth is yet to be defined. 
      Recent transcriptomic data, combined with mouse genetic tools, have the capacity 
      to provide important cell-type resolution for the physiological and behavioral 
      function of pulp-innervating sensory neurons. Importantly, these tools can be 
      applied to determine the neuronal origin of acute dental pain that coincides with 
      tooth damage as well as pain stemming from tissue inflammation (i.e., pulpitis) 
      toward developing treatment strategies aimed at relieving these distinct forms of 
      pain.

AB  - Unlike olfaction, taste, touch, vision, and proprioception, which are widespread 
      across animal phyla, hearing is found only in vertebrates and some arthropods. 
      The vast majority of invertebrate species are thus considered insensitive to 
      sound. Here, we challenge this conventional view by showing that the earless 
      nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound at frequencies reaching the kHz range. 
      Sound vibrates C. elegans skin, which acts as a pressure-to-displacement 
      transducer similar to vertebrate eardrum, activates sound-sensitive FLP/PVD 
      neurons attached to the skin, and evokes phonotaxis behavior. We identified two 
      nAChRs that transduce sound signals independently of ACh, revealing an unexpected 
      function of nAChRs in mechanosensation. Thus, the ability to sense airborne sound 
      is not restricted to vertebrates and arthropods as previously thought, and might 
      have evolved multiple times independently in the animal kingdom, suggesting 
      convergent evolution. Our studies also demonstrate that animals without ears may 
      not be presumed to be sound insensitive.

AB  - The parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis locates human hosts via thermal 
      cues through unknown neural mechanisms. A new study finds that the heat-sensing 
      neuron AFD mediates attraction to human body heat. Interestingly, this neuron 
      also mediates thermotaxis in the nematode C. elegans.

AB  - Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are expressed in many nonneural 
      tissues where their functions are not well known. Using C. elegans as a model, a 
      new study demonstrated that colonization of the Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria 
      E. faecalis in the intestine causes intestinal distention. Two TRPM channels 
      sense such intestinal distension to trigger fast pathogen avoidance behavior, 
      thereby limiting pathogen infection. This work signifies the novel role of TRP 
      channels in gut physiology and pathogen defense.

AB  - Despite lacking ears, the nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound and engages 
      in phonotaxis behavior, enabling it to locate and avoid sound sources.(1) How 
      worms sense sound, however, is not well understood. Here, we report an 
      interesting observation that worms respond only to sounds emitted by small but 
      not large speakers, indicating that they preferentially respond to localized 
      sound sources. Notably, sounds emitted by small speakers form a sharp sound 
      pressure gradient across the worm body, while sounds from large speakers do not, 
      suggesting that worms sense sound pressure gradients rather than absolute sound 
      pressure. Analysis of phonotaxis behavior, sound-evoked skin vibration, and 
      sound-sensitive neuron activities further support this model. We suggest that the 
      ability to sense sound pressure gradients provides a potential mechanism for 
      worms to distinguish sounds generated by their predators, which are typically 
      small animals, from those produced by large animals or background noise. As 
      vertebrate cochlea and some insect ears can also detect sound pressure gradients, 
      our results reveal that sensing of sound pressure gradients may represent a 
      common mechanism in auditory sensation across animal phyla. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - How neural circuits drive behavior is a central question in neuroscience. Proper 
      execution of motor behavior requires precise coordination of many neurons. Within 
      a motor circuit, individual neurons tend to play discrete roles by promoting or 
      suppressing motor output. How exactly neurons function in specific roles to fine 
      tune motor output is not well understood. In C. elegans, the interneuron RIM 
      plays important yet complex roles in locomotion behavior. Here, we show that RIM 
      both promotes and suppresses distinct features of locomotion behavior to fine 
      tune motor output. This dual function is achieved via the excitation and 
      inhibition of the same motor circuit by electrical and chemical 
      neurotransmission, respectively. Additionally, this bi-directional regulation 
      contributes to motor adaptation in animals placed in novel environments. Our 
      findings reveal that individual neurons within a neural circuit may act in 
      opposing ways to regulate circuit dynamics to fine tune behavioral output.

TI  - Regulation of photosensation by hydrogen peroxide and antioxidants in C. elegans.

AB  - The eyeless C. elegans exhibits robust phototaxis behavior in response to 
      short-wavelength light, particularly UV light. C. elegans senses light through 
      LITE-1, a unique photoreceptor protein that belongs to the invertebrate taste 
      receptor family. However, it remains unclear how LITE-1 is regulated. Here, we 
      performed a forward genetic screen for genes that when mutated suppress LITE-1 
      function. One group of lite-1 suppressors are the genes required for producing 
      the two primary antioxidants thioredoxin and glutathione, suggesting that 
      oxidization of LITE-1 inhibits its function. Indeed, the oxidant hydrogen 
      peroxide (H2O2) suppresses phototaxis behavior and inhibits the photoresponse in 
      photoreceptor neurons, whereas other sensory behaviors are relatively less 
      vulnerable to H2O2. Conversely, antioxidants can rescue the phenotype of lite-1 
      suppressor mutants and promote the photoresponse. As UV light illumination 
      generates H2O2, we propose that upon light activation of LITE-1, light-produced 
      H2O2 then deactivates LITE-1 to terminate the photoresponse, while antioxidants 
      may promote LITE-1's recovery from its inactive state. Our studies provide a 
      potential mechanism by which H2O2 and antioxidants act synergistically to 
      regulate photosensation in C. elegans.

AB  - Temperature profoundly affects aging in both poikilotherms and homeotherms. A 
      general belief is that lower temperatures extend lifespan, whereas higher 
      temperatures shorten it. Although this "temperature law" is widely accepted, it 
      has not been extensively tested. Here, we systematically evaluated the role of 
      temperature in lifespan regulation in C. elegans. We found that, although 
      exposure to low temperatures at the adult stage prolongs lifespan, 
      low-temperature treatment at the larval stage surprisingly reduces lifespan. 
      Interestingly, this differential effect of temperature on longevity in larvae and 
      adults is mediated by the same thermosensitive TRP channel TRPA-1 that signals to 
      the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. DAF-16/FOXO and TRPA-1 act in larva to 
      shorten lifespan but extend lifespan in adulthood. DAF-16/FOXO differentially 
      regulates gene expression in larva and adult in a temperature-dependent manner. 
      Our results uncover complexity underlying temperature modulation of longevity, 
      demonstrating that temperature differentially regulates lifespan at different 
      stages of life.

AB  - Diet affects nearly every aspect of animal life such as development, metabolism, 
      behavior, and aging, both directly by supplying nutrients and indirectly through 
      gut microbiota. C. elegans feeds on bacteria, and like other animals, different 
      bacterial diets induce distinct dietary responses in the worm. However, the lack 
      of certain critical tools hampers the use of worms as a model for dietary 
      signaling. Here, we genetically engineered the bacterial strain OP50, the 
      standard laboratory diet for C. elegans, making it compatible for dsRNA 
      production and delivery. Using this RNAi-compatible OP50 strain and the other 
      bacterial strain HT115, we feed worms different diets while delivering RNAi to 
      interrogate the genetic basis underlying diet-dependent differential modulation 
      of development, metabolism, behavior, and aging. We show by RNAi that 
      neuroendocrine and mTOR pathways are involved in mediating differential dietary 
      responses. This genetic tool greatly facilitates the use of C. elegans as a model 
      for dietary signaling.

TI  - Fresh versus frozen engineered bone-ligament-bone grafts for sheep anterior 
      cruciate ligament repair.
PG  - 548-56
LID - 10.1089/ten.TEC.2014.0542 [doi]
AB  - Surgical intervention is often required to restore knee instability in patients 
      with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The most commonly used grafts for 
      ACL reconstruction are tendon autografts or allografts. These current options, 
      however, have shown failure rates requiring revision and continued instability in 
      the long term. The mismatched biomechanical properties of the current tendon 
      grafts compared with native ACL tissue are thought to contribute to these poor 
      outcomes and potential risk of early onset osteoarthritis. As a possible solution 
      to these issues, our laboratory has fabricated tissue-engineered ligament 
      constructs that exhibit structural and functional properties similar to those of 
      native ACL tissue after 6 months implantation. In addition, these 
      tissue-engineered grafts achieve vascular and neural development that exceeds 
      those of patellar tendon grafts. However, the utility of our tissue-engineered 
      grafts is limited by the labor-intensive method required to produce the 
      constructs and the need to use the constructs fresh, directly from the cell 
      culturing system. Ideally, these constructs would be fabricated and stored until 
      needed. Thus, in this study, we investigated the efficacy of freezing our 
      tissue-engineered constructs as a method of preservation before use for ACL 
      reconstruction. We hypothesized that frozen constructs would have similar 
      histological and biomechanical outcomes compared with our fresh model. Our 
      results showed that 6 months postimplantation as an ACL replacement graft, both 
      our tissue-engineered fresh and frozen grafts demonstrated similar mechanical and 
      histological outcomes, indicating that freezing is a suitable method for 
      preserving and storing our graft before ACL reconstruction. The ability to use 
      frozen constructs significantly increases the versatility of our graft technology 
      expanding the clinical utility of our graft.

TI  - Intradental mechano-nociceptors serve as sentinels that prevent tooth damage.
LID - 2024.05.11.593684 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2024.05.11.593684 [doi]
AB  - Pain is the anticipated output of the trigeminal sensory neurons that innervate 
      the tooth's vital interior (1,2) ; however, the contribution of intradental 
      neurons to healthy tooth sensation has yet to be defined. Here, we employ in vivo 
      Ca (2+) imaging to identify and define a population of myelinated high-threshold 
      mechano-nociceptors (intradental HTMRs) that detect superficial structural damage 
      of the tooth, produce pain, and initiate a jaw opening reflex. Intradental HTMRs 
      remain inactive when direct forces are applied to the intact tooth but become 
      responsive to forces when the structural integrity of the tooth is compromised, 
      and the dentin or pulp is exposed. Their terminals collectively innervate the 
      inner dentin through overlapping receptive fields, allowing them to monitor the 
      superficial structures of the tooth. Indeed, intradental HTMRs detect superficial 
      enamel damage and encode its degree, and their responses persist in the absence 
      of either PIEZO2 or Na (v) 1.8 (3,4) . As predicted, chemogenetic activation of 
      intradental HTMRs results in a marked pain phenotype like that produced by 
      systemic chemogenetic activation of nociceptors. Remarkably, optogenetic 
      activation of intradental HTMRs triggers a rapid, jaw opening reflex via 
      contraction of the digastric muscle. Taken together, our data indicate that 
      intradental HTMRs serve as sentinels that guard against mechanical threats to the 
      tooth; their activation not only triggers pain, but also results in physical 
      tooth separation, which would prevent damage during mastication. Our work 
      provides a new perspective of intradental neurons, highlighting their protective 
      role, and illustrates the functional diversity of interoreceptors.

LID - 10.1101/2025.10.05.680544 [doi]
AB  - The ability to sense and avoid noxious environments is essential for animal 
      survival; yet, how this is achieved at the behavioral, neuronal, and molecular 
      levels is not well understood. Here, we use Drosophila larvae as a model to 
      investigate how animals sense and avoid cold temperatures. By implementing 
      custom-built thermoelectric devices capable of delivering rapid and precise 
      thermal stimuli, we find that cold delivered to the larval head evokes robust 
      escape behavioral responses. We identify a group of head-located cold-sensitive 
      neurons as necessary and sufficient for such avoidance responses. We further 
      demonstrate that the kainate-type glutamate receptor Clumsy acts as a novel cold 
      sensor required for head cold sensitivity. Knockdown of Clumsy in head 
      cold-sensing neurons suppresses their cold sensitivity. Heterologous expression 
      of Clumsy confers cold sensitivity. Our results show that Drosophila larvae have 
      evolved the capacity to detect and avoid cold temperatures through a previously 
      uncharacterized cold-sensing mechanism.

AB  - The genetic tractability, well-mapped circuitry, and diverse behavioral 
      repertoire of the nematode C. elegans make it an ideal model for physiological 
      and behavioral studies. A wide range of methods has been developed for analyzing 
      C. elegans behaviors, evolving with advances in technology such as videography 
      and computer-assisted analysis. However, unlike organisms with distinct body 
      features such as limbs and wings, the contour of C. elegans is rather uniform, 
      posing unique challenges for automated analyses of C. elegans behavior. Here, we 
      introduce LabGym-an open-source, artificial intelligence (AI)-based platform we 
      recently developed-to the C. elegans research community. We trained deep learning 
      models in LabGym capable of automatically categorizing and quantifying multiple 
      user-defined parameters of worm locomotion behavior in multi-worm videos with 
      high accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrated their efficacy in quantifying 
      locomotion changes in aging worms. Our work offers a cost-effective, 
      user-accessible, and comprehensive approach to behavioral analysis in C. elegans.

      challenged drug-naive C. elegans with an acute dose of nicotine (100 μmol/l) 
      while recording changes in their locomotion speed. Although nicotine treatment 
      stimulated locomotion speed in wild-type C. elegans, the same treatment reduced 
      locomotion speed in mutants defective in insulin signaling. This phenotype could 
      be suppressed by mutations in daf-16, a gene encoding a FOXO transcription factor 
      that acts downstream of insulin signaling. Our data suggest that insulin 
      signaling genes, daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, akt-1, and akt-2, modulate behavioral 
      responses to nicotine in C. elegans, indicating a genetic link between nicotine 
      behavior and insulin signaling.
