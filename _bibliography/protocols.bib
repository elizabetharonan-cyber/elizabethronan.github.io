  additional_info = {<br>**Cover story:** Research using the model organism nematode C. elegans has greatly facilitated our understanding of sensory biology, including touch, olfaction, taste, vision and proprioception. While hearing had long been considered to be restricted to vertebrates and some arthropods, we recently discovered that C. elegans is capable of sensing and responding to airborne sound in a frequency and sound source-size dependent manner. C. elegans auditory sensation occurs when airborne sound physically vibrates their external cuticle (skin) to activate the sound-sensitive mechanosensory FLP/PVD neurons via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), triggering aversive phonotaxis behavior. Here, the authors report stepwise methods to characterize these three features of C. elegans auditory sensation, including sound-evoked skin vibration, neuronal activation, and behavior. This approach provides an accessible platform to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying auditory sensation and mechanotransduction mechanisms in C. elegans.}
