**Elizabeth A. Ronan (she/her/hers)** is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry. Her current project investigates the molecular, cellular, and physiological roles of trigeminal somatosensory neurons innervating discrete craniofacial tissues, focusing on understanding how these neurons function in the oral cavity. This work is performed in Dr. Joshua Emrick’s laboratory and uses in vivo calcium imaging, intersectional mouse genetics, and AI-based behavioral analysis to uncover novel mechanisms of orofacial sensation.

Elizabeth’s research broadly focuses on neural encoding of orofacial somatosensation and pain, integrating insights from both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems. Her long-term goal is to establish an independent laboratory to investigate how sensory neurons detect, encode, and transmit information that drives perception, behavior, and homeostasis.

She employs a wide range of techniques in her research, including in vivo calcium imaging, opto- and chemogenetics, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, transgenic model generation, and AI-assisted behavioral analyses. During her doctoral training at the University of Michigan in Dr. Shawn Xu’s lab, she discovered an evolutionarily conserved molecular cold receptor, GluK2, and provided the first evidence that _C. elegans_ can sense airborne sound, highlighting sensory modalities previously thought absent in invertebrates.
